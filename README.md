# Artificial Intelligence

This course had 4 main assignments, and I averaged 97% on these assignments.

1) <b>Sokoban solver</b>: implemented a heuristic to quickly solve any sokoban grid configuration.
2) <b>Othello agent</b>: implemented min max and alpha beta pruning to produce a game playing agent
3) <b>Constraint Satisfaction: Tenner Grid</b>: solves any CSP using Generalized Arc Consistency
4) <b> Probabilistic Reasoning: NLP Part-of-Speech Tagger</b>: built an HMM (Hidden Markov Model) and implemented Viterbi's algorithm to determine the most likely sequence.
